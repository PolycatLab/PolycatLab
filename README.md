# Poly(cat) Lab

The group's main actvity centres around **polymerisation catalysis**, including the design of catalysts and the development of original methodologies for sustainable polymers. We use combined experimental annd computationnal approaches to elucidate reaction mechanisms and guide towards the development of new catalysts and reactions.

The group also promotes the use of data repositories for the publication of **FAIR data**.
